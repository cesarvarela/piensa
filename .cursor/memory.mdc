# Style Guide
- Use braces on new lines for control structures (if, try/catch, switch)

# Streaming Feature
- The CLI supports streaming responses with the `-s` or `--stream` flag
- Both OpenAI and Anthropic providers implement streaming
- Streaming bypasses the spinner and directly writes to stdout
- Non-streaming mode uses a spinner to indicate processing
