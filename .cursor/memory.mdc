# Style Guide
- Use braces on new lines for control structures (if, try/catch, switch)

# Streaming Feature
- The CLI supports streaming responses with the `-s` or `--stream` flag
- Both OpenAI and Anthropic providers implement streaming
- Streaming bypasses the spinner and directly writes to stdout
- Non-streaming mode uses a spinner to indicate processing
# OpenAI API Parameters
- Do not set the temperature parameter in OpenAI API calls
- The o1 model does not support the temperature parameter and will return error 400
- For consistency, we do not set temperature for any model
